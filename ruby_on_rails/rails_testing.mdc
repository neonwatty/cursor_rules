# Rails Testing Best Practices and Rules

- Use **Minitest** and **Capybara** for all Ruby/Rails testing. Do not use RSpec.
- Focus on writing **unit, model, controller, and integration tests**. System tests are not required.
- Write tests **frequently**: add small, focused tests whenever new code is added or existing code is changed.
- Keep tests clear, maintainable, and DRY.
- Use fixtures for test data (not factories).

## Vite/JavaScript Testing

- For Vite-managed JavaScript, write **npm-based tests** (e.g., using Vitest or Jest).
- Apply the same principle: write small, focused tests frequently as new JS code is added or changed.
- Keep JavaScript tests clear, maintainable, and colocated with the code they test when possible.

These rules help ensure your Rails and JavaScript codebases remain reliable, maintainable, and easy to refactor.
